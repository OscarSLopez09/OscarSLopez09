##
I am passionate about technology and the role it plays in enabling businesses to achieve their goals. I am excited to continue to grow my career in Cloud Engineering, and I look forward to contributing to the success of future projects and teams.

I'm creating several projects and posting them to Git Hub, which allows me to demonstrate my technical skill in cloud computing. I will continue to upload several projects that will help me strengthen my ability to do the right things at the right time.
